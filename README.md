# ToSWatcher

Spiders to crawl ToS (Terms of Service) as plain text from various sites / services.

## Why

Most sites / services do not provide archives of their previous ToS.
 Since they are free to modify these terms anytime, it is hard for the user to
 understand what exactly got changed. A site might create a pretty innocent
 version of ToS at first, and change the content to contain some evil rules
 as if they were agreed by the user at the first time.

You could set up a Git repository to contain all the ToS versions, and use
 this project to periodically crawl and save ToS texts into that repository.
